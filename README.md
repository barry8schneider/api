GovTribe's Government Data API
======
Get unified access to federal procurement data from a single API. We extract several types of entities:

* **Project** - A U.S. federal government contract or opportunity
* **Agency**  - A U.S. federal government agency that executes Projects
* **Office**  - An organizational unit within an Agency that executes Projects
* **Person**  - A point of contact for one or more Projects
* **Vendor**  - A legal entity that has been awarded a Project
* **Category**  - A topical grouping, based off North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes or Product and Service (PSC) codes
* **Protest**  - A GAO protest entity
* **Activity**  - Activity represents the ongoing activity of one or more of the other entity types.
